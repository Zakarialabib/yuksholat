## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd yuksholat
npm install
```

...then start:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5173/index.html](http://127.0.0.1:5173/index.html). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.
